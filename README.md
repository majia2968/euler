learning Ruby / loving math via project euler.

for those who don't know of it, Project Euler is a collection of math
    problems that require greater computational power than the human brain
    alone. Check it out at projecteuler.net

note that these files contain my solutions and some thought processes. I
request that those also working on the project use these as a reference
only, and not as a source of "the right answers". Math is fun.
